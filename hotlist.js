It wasn't intended to imply that he is a recipient, but as myself releasing a program attributed to him instead.<br><br>It's a simple program, but that doesn't make me a simple coder. I am going to release complicated programs (with two in the making), and maybe even some graphics. <br><br>Moreover, I made this program to be simple; I want people to only focus on what's there. I'm not sure if you're aware, but programs aren't about votes or how many lines of code it has; it's about the message the code is meant to convey. <br><br>I don't appreciate when people criticize a perfectly good program. I want KA to be a place where coders can respect other works; even when they aren't great. I know you may think of this program as simple, but to me (and many others) it's a work of art portraying the meaning of friendship, and what happens when you lose that.<br><br>I'm sorry you feel this way about this program, but I have 50 others who would probably disagree with you. Your opinion is fine, but I am justifying my side of the case.<br><br>As Cookie said (Thanks, Cookie!), It's not my fault it got lots of votes."
