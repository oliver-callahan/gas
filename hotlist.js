Winston's favorite food was a donut. He would sneak into the local bakery and steal a handful of donuts while the baker wasn't looking. His obsession worsened as he got into high school. He would usually spend all his lunch money on donuts and nothing else. By college, Winston's addiction deteriorated even more. He had spent all his life savings on his favorite mayonnaise-filled donuts. Winston gradually turned round, into the shape of a donut. His mouth became larger as well. Right after graduating college, Winston surgically enlarged his mouth to keep up with his unhealthy addiction. He was now eating more than 26 million donuts every day. Winston's debt from eating donuts continued to pile up. Soon enough, he had to move into a dirty apartment and sleep next to rats and cockroaches. Today, Winston is 80 and still scouring the streets for donuts.</p>\n    \n    <img src = \"https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/creatures/Winston.png\">\n    \n    \n    <h2 id = \"h2\">Mr. Pants</h2>\n    \n    <p>In a galaxy far, far away there was a child named Derf Biffbaff. In his bedroom he had a massive closet just for his pants. He would admiringly look at his collection every day, for hours at a time. The only other clothing items he had was a pair of mismatched socks, a pair of stinky underwear that was never washed, and a threadbare shirt. As Derf's obsession grew and grew, the big closet full of pants he owned was renovated into a massive storage facility filled to the brim with his pants. Shortly after building the storage facility, Derf changed his name to Mr. Pants. Mr. Pants began manufacturing and selling pants. Finally, after many years of expanding his business, he became a multi-billionaire. Today he is 82, living comfortably in his mansion entirely made out of pants.\n    </p>\n    \n    <img src = \"https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/avatars/mr-pants.png\">\n    \n    <h2 id = \"h2\">Oh Noes</h2>\n    \n    <p>When he was young, Oh Noes had an obsession with pointing out mistakes. This resulted in him getting detention in school from pointing out the teacher's mistakes. Oh Noes tried to stop calling mistakes out, but failed miserably. He even tried putting a metal mask over his mouth, but the mask exploded after holding in endless streams of words coming from his mouth. Oh Noes once participated in a fast-talking contest, but was disqualified after talking so fast the judges thought he was cheating. After leaving the contest depressed and beaten, Oh Noes saw a poster falling down from the sky. He grabbed the poster and started reading. Oh Noes tried talking about all the grammatical errors the poster had, but was deeply intrigued by the \"Mistake Pointer\" job opening a website called Khan Academy offered. He drove to the hiring site, and asked for an interview. A woman stepped out of a door and interviewed him. 17 hours later, after Oh Noes had pointed out 103,390 errors about Khan Academy, he got the job. He was overjoyed! After working for years at the job and not taking care for himself, Oh Noes eventually disintegrated into a green ball. Today, he is 86 and still tirelessly pointing out mistakes. </p>\n    \n    <img src = \"https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/creatures/OhNoes.png\">\n    \n    <h2 id = \"h2\">Mr. Pink</h2>\n    \n    <p>Mr. Pink had the jitters ever since he was born. He simply couldn't control them. He was formerly known to be Mr. White. Often, while he was drinking, he would get the jitters and spill the drink all over the floor. In school, taking tests would also give him the jitters. He would try as hard as he could to control them, but the test would often be a series of scribbles as he turned it in. The teachers he had could not recognize what his scribbles meant, so he got failed every subject in school. He would be the center of food fights after his jitters made him spill his food on other people. This happened all the way until he had failed high school. Mr. White wandered around, not knowing what to do. As Mr. White passed the local restaurant, a sign caught his eye. They were hiring! Mr. White had always liked to cook, so he applied and got a position as a soup chef. One morning, as he was cooking tomato soup, he suddenly felt the jitters come in. As a result, the bowl of soup flew into the air and drenched Mr. White. He was now colored a dark red. Since taking a shower was impossible because of his jitters, he stuck with the color. Because he had not paid close attention in art class, he couldn't tell the difference between pink and red and instead renamed himself the wrong color. Today, Mr. Pink is 75 and still hasn't taken a shower.</p>\n    \n    <img src = \"https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/avatars/mr-pink.png\">\n    \n\n    \n    <a href = \"#top\"><p>Back to top</p></a>\n    \n    </div>\n    \n    <h1 id = \"h12\">User-made stories</h1>\n    \n    <div id = \"divv\">\n        \n        <p>this could be you...</p>\n    </div>\n    \n    \n    \n    <p id = \"sublink\">Like this program?

Unlike the other avatars, who sported bright hues and distinct features, the Aqualine shimmered in a mesmerizing gradient of blues, like the depths of an ocean.\n\nThe Aqualine was a curious soul, always gliding through virtual classrooms, exploring the realms of mathematics, science, and history. Each day, it would dive into new subjects, soaking up knowledge like a sponge. One of its favorite spots was Math Mountain, where challenges rose like steep cliffs, pushing the Aqualine to solve problems and conquer equations.\n\nOne day, while exploring the Art Gallery, the Aqualine stumbled upon a blank canvas. Inspired, it decided to paint the beauty of learning. With each brushstroke, the avatar depicted its journey: a swirling galaxy of numbers, a vibrant forest of scientific discoveries, and a skyline of historical events.\n\nAs the Aqualine painted, something extraordinary happened. The canvas began to glow, and a swirling vortex emerged. Out of nowhere, a human named BlueDragon, known for his love of learning, was sucked into the digital realm. Surrounded by colors and creativity, he felt an exhilarating rush.\n\nIn an instant, the Aqualine and BlueDragon fused together. The shimmering blue hues morphed into a more vibrant form, taking on the name “BlueDragon.” With newfound strength and perspective, BlueDragon realized he could harness the power of collaboration to inspire others.\n\nTogether, they thrived in this digital world, becoming a beacon of knowledge and creativity, reminding everyone that learning is a beautiful journey best traveled together."},{"date":"2024-10-21T12:56:07.849144Z","author":{"name":"Electric Dolphin ⚡️🐬","id":"kaid_1188776231699286995947997","avatar":"/images/avatars/svg/cs-hopper-cool.svg"},"text":"Name: Electric Dolphin\n\nOne day, there was a character named cute/ChestLid. cute/ChestLid resembled a chest's lid, but it was much more. Some people used the sound rpg/door-open to make the sound of a chest opening, meaning cute/ChestLid was secretly a door! So after all the other avatars found out about this they used cute/ChestLid as a door instead. But cute/ChestLid was also a chest lid as well. His friend cute/ChestOpen was incomplete without cute/ChestLid. so cute/ChestLid thought of a plan. He would be a chest lid half the time and a door the other half. So the avatars were like \"why there no door half the time.\" and cute/ChestLid said \"am also a chest lid.\" and the avatars were like \"oh ok.\" and so cute/ChestLid was able to be a door while still helping cute/ChestOpen. The end."}]},{"replyCount":0,"votes":9,"date":"2024-10-20T21:22:32.770815Z","author":{"name":"I need sleep","id":"kaid_1035102859463321737602047","avatar":"/images/avatars/svg/cs-winston.svg"},"text":"Do you like looking at random computer programs?
